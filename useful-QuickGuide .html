                <h6 class="marg-bot">PHP Introduction  </h6>
                <h6 class="marg-bot">PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. 
                    Rasmus Lerdorf released the first version of PHP way back in 1994. Initially, PHP was supposed 
                    to be an abbreviation for "Personal Home Page", but it now stands for the recursive initialism "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".</h6>
                <h6 class="marg-bot">Lerdorf began PHP development in 1993 by writing several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C,
                    which he used to maintain in his personal homepage. Later on, He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases. This implementation of PHP was "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
                </h6>  
                <h6 class="marg-bot">Today, PHP is the worldâ€™s most popular server-side programming language for building web applications. Over the years, it has
                     gone through successive revisions and versions.</h6>
                <h6 class="marg-bot">PHP Versions </h6>
                <h6 class="marg-bot">PHP was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 as a simple set of CGI binaries written in C. He called this suite of scripts "Personal Home Page Tools". It can be regarded as PHP version 1.0.

                <ul class="color-white custom-margin">
